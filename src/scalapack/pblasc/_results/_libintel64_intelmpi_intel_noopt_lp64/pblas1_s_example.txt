=== START OF EXAMPLE ===================
Two vectors in 22-dimensional space
Block size for distribution: 3

=== PROGRESS ===========================
.. Vectors are distributed ( p?geadd ) ..
.. Value of norm for each vector is computed ( p?nrm2 ) ..
.. Vectors are normalized ( p?scal ) ..
.. Cosine between vectors is computed ( p?dot ) ..
== Results ==
||x||=1.000000 - length of vector x
||y||=8.000000 - length of vector y
cos(x^y)=-0.999940
angle(x^y)=179.370691 degrees
